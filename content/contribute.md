## 💰 Financial support

The simplest and most favored way to help the project is to **contribute
financially** by making a donation through one of these services:

- [Liberapay]({{< param liberapay >}})
- [Ko-fi]({{< param kofi >}})

Supporting us financially is essential to the project, so we're extremely
grateful to anyone that can make a donation.

## 🩷 Visibility

A cheaper but still appreciated help is to **talk about the project on social
networks**. You can find us on the major ones (see footer); feel free to publicly
interact with us there.

## ⚙️ Development

If you are a developer willing to contribute, it is encouraged to [get in
touch][contact] with us before doing any significant development work to avoid
any late rejection or simply duplicated effort. That being said, the development
happens on [GitHub]({{< param github >}}), and a [developer documentation][dev-doc]
is available.

[contact]: {{< ref "/contact" >}}
[dev-doc]: {{< param doc >}}/dev
