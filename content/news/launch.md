We are officialy launching the Nope Foundry project today!

We aim to provide a free and open source cross-platform framework for motion
design, 2D composition and visual effects.

The project is still in early stage, but it is already usable for creating all
kind of content (check out the [Demos](/demos)!).

Find us on social networks (see footer) or come discuss with us on [Discord][discord].
