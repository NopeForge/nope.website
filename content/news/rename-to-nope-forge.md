Due to the pressure from a company that trademarked a common word from the
dictionary, we were forced to rename the project.

Nope Foundry is now called **Nope Forge**.

Despite the name change, our mission doesn't change: we're doing our best to
provide a free and open source cross-platform framework for motion design, 2D
composition and visual effects.

The previous website now redirects here transparently, so this shouldn't cause a
lot of inconvenience. On the other hand, the previous links to the documentation
are unfortunately now broken. To address potential similar issues in the future,
we now have a more stable redirection from [doc.nopeforge.org][doc].
