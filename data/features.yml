    Building a scene means building a graph for the rendering engine. The
    declarative nature of a graph gives the ability to structure large scale
    scenes visually, and resources within can intuitively be shared. The graphs
    are platform agnostic, and with the help of serialization can be transmitted
    easily for re-use elsewhere.
